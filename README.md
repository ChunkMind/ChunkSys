ChunkSys is a software project that aims to implement a client-server system with packet-based communication using RabbitMQ as the messaging system. The project focuses on providing a scalable and robust solution for data exchange between clients and servers in a distributed architecture.

The packet-based system used by ChunkSys is based on dividing data into smaller units, known as packets, to facilitate the transmission and reception of data. These packets contain header and body information that are used to ensure error-free delivery of data.

RabbitMQ is used as the messaging system for implementing the packet exchange between clients and servers in the ChunkSys project. RabbitMQ is an open-source messaging system based on the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), which provides a reliable and scalable messaging mechanism for data transfer.

In summary, ChunkSys is a software project that focuses on implementing a client-server system with packet-based communication using RabbitMQ as the messaging system. The solution provided by this project enables reliable and scalable transmission and reception of data in a distributed architecture.
